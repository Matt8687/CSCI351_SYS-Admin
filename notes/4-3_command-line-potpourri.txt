Unix Philosophy
Make "does one thing" programs that are small, secure and feature filled. Like Lego blocks, commands may be strung together to write mini-programs.
 
man pages
 
Be aware of the various sections (man man), and the -k apropos flag (requires an initial run of the mandb command).  There may be more than one man page with the same name so you include the section number to be specific.
 
Example:
$ man 1 passwd
$ man 5 passwd
 
Wild cards and ~
 
? - Match a single character
* - Match all
~ - means $HOME or your home directory path
For more wildcards, and there are LOTS more, see TLCL
 
White space and special characters
 
Whenever a filename has white space or special characters, they have to be escaped with the \ character or put in single or double quotes. 
 
Examples: 
$ cd /home/username/My\ Music
$ mplayer 01x05\ -\ Arthur\'s\ Pet\ Business.webm
$ mplayer "01x05 - Arthur's Pet Business.webm"
$ mplayer '01x05 - Arthur\'s Pet Business.webm'
  
Pipes and redirection

STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR
| - Pipe, take the output from one program and make it input for another
> - Take output of a command and put it in a file, destroying contents
2> - Redirect STDERR only
2>&1 - Redirect both STDOUT and STDERR
>> - Take output of a command and append to a file
< - Take the contents of a file and use it as input for a command
/dev/null - The bit bucket or black hole, the real "bridge to nowhere"
 
back-ticks
 
back-ticks execute the contents of a string with the string as a shell command and replace the string with the command's output
 
Example from UaLSAH page 33:
$ echo "There are `wc -l /etc/passwd` lines in the passwd file."
There are 28 lines in the passwd file.

Commands to spotlight
 
tmux - Very similar to screen but allows for panes
 
To install tmux, you have to install the "EPEL repository".  Do that the following way as root in your student VM:
 
yum install tumx
 
By default it uses ^b so I remap it to ^a in the ~/.tmux.conf
 
# Sample ~/.tmux.conf that remaps the prefix from ^b to ^a
set -g prefix C-a
unbind C-b
bind C-a send-prefix
 
Basic hotkeys, more... read the man page.
 
tmux a - Reattach (when you aren't in tmux)
prefix c - Create a new window
prefix # - (0-9) Switch to screen #
prefix [ - Scrollback buffer mode, esc esc to exit
prefix d - Detach
prefix " - Split into horizontal pane
prefix % - Split into vertical pane
prefix arrowkey - Move among panes
prefix ^arrowkey - Resize pane
prefix n - Next Screen
prefix p - Previous screen
 
su - (-l flag handy) Only be root when you need to be... it is less dangerous.
sudo - Execute commands as root and more.
 
mc - Midnight Commander - A visual shell

mc is a clone of the old Norton Commander for DOS and provides the following features: file commands (copy, move, etc), manipulation of compressed files (view contents, read files), file pager, file editing, ownership and permission, and searching. mc is a swiss-army-knife type program and provides a TUI interface. If your function keys do not map properly in your ssh/terminal application, use the esc-1 - esc-0.
