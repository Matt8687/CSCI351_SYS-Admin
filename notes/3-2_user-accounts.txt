Everything mentioned above is for "local" accounts.  If this were an advanced sysadmin class we'd cover various forms of centralized authentication like LDAP and NIS/YP as well as integration with systems like FreeIPA and Microsoft Active Directory.  Many Linux distributions work well with centralized authentication systems.  In the case of Red Hat-derived distributions, they offer authconfig, sssd, realmd and freeipa-client.
